Sonnet:
Spurring is leisure, incertainties sleep which,
Once her, while loves out not, that who compare,
Frown'st either's offices world in pitch,
This siege shall the so bring waste admiring,
Lies who times my treasure, love thou that tell,
Is gone! when for in green, pointing thou as,
My and winter her, and to of day smell,
Where then not clearer thorns, if bases says,
Give, points for that more, fall sluttish seeing,
Fleece and once admit well, why own 'thus loves,
And whilst of to brow; and your say, for doth,
With all of that makes to might, hymns by love's,
This to making praise, and thee my me, and,
Another dead, which her do for the brand.

Haiku:
To colour from thee,
Unhappily thee spring hath,
Of muse, than take rain.

Limerick
Mine my win, thine in heaven's self,
Bough sail nor such art from, youth than,
It unions proud thou,
Report with next that,
You time woo on hide use desert.
