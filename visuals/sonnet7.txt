Sonnet:
Plagues my trim who for me feeding, and both,
Assailed, the thence evermore not blame thy,
Beauty of to his same my have cross, growth,
Yet thy view, mark love, and i death defy,
The virtue, till owners rank unkindness me,
Foul: let then thy ruminate how by my,
Horses year, nor instinct that death it thee,
Grief's in substance nymphs thee audit, defy,
Was but ransom change, in doth numbers, to,
That a me survive winter eyes hath though,
Mistress' unseen alchemy nor you you,
Leisure: even then which sight, in mouths woe,
Durst my inward love as ten little date,
Wards to distilled hours no you, when wait.

Haiku:
Tied and his you him,
Ride, with they wise death, back dumb,
Grind my beauty dead.

Limerick
In that art raiment all loud my,
I turn, of engraft golden try,
My should me still he,
There to the thee three,
You big absence put'st or tie.
