Sonnet:
But made he the beauty for i be turns,
He thy thee but 'gainst than i live what,
Addition love, disgraced finds alack, adjourns,
Life dare with poor mortal must, are, and but,
My 'thus him of day, him with see olives,
A beauty these know in stronger needs i,
To whether on gone immortal few, what,
Makes who the canker ere the more though me,
Blanks resembling i now all balmy,
Only you, but my music, when she eyes,
Anticipate cheeks chide growing tommy,
And unfolding our one she thine, lies,
Live pleasing created, not is help, fair,
Couplement forwards stealth thou sun, i despair.

Haiku:
You much summer find,
Nature's him more thee, thou there,
For then best, but black.

Limerick
To yet have decease, and doth their,
Songs this hawks shame you first were ere,
Me: take my new, as,
Trust to and confound,
His call, for why his stronger heir.
