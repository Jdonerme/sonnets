Sonnet:
Not woman's fold mansion thy than of not,
The huge scandal, in hairs with hue are but,
Pen jewel the one, whence thee, apple plot,
When wretchcd love's powerful whose all cut,
In an alack were if for, it by none that,
Red, of such my much mine to heavily,
Thou fierce what love his self lie, votary at,
Eating with hell, and the level thee, a,
Gift that peace though my amiss which his rite,
Taught are be with sovereign and all this foul,
That assailed in be be that i not light,
Shame, shall endure hold behold will his owl,
That a wood be sun of thy wind, and dost,
Not hied of passed but greet misuse they cost.

Haiku:
Other than end, do,
Crow, wilt require these sweet,
Can in that him thy.

Bring, whilst up my fortune they please,
Just madness of in this, so these,
Still love with so was,
You translate, not glass,
Love and minutes believe stays: trees.
