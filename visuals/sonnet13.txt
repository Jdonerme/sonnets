Sonnet:
Forbear blind sight sense semblance upon still,
Gentlest wood the sleep thy duty, i,
I of night, and she profaned the first kill,
That not truths name, and base for this false eye,
Memory minutes of what to my muse,
Dost how which ten, and thou wealth! and then first,
Appetite world never had, a looks use,
You' on false with length sky thou time and worst,
Very wilt shall seeming would then to i,
Eyes my all, in what calls time's hand be on,
For the subdued he laid are dear might free,
Survive live argument, his grief and moan,
More his come have on to sad gently which,
Eyes fickle change thy desert greet mine, pitch.

Haiku:
Eyes is so know the,
Attainted, every low love,
A parts, but like me.

Limerick
Your looks as thy hours! wretched,
Thee most in unknown, make strength to,
Bent, are have shall their,
Leave me my thy swear,
Beauties: yet thou, and hath for my.
