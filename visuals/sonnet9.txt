Sonnet:
Suspect are stand, love a case, daily a,
Not it: thee the all now me is thou love,
Been do and times have that lov'st translate,
Far but quick to the true, duty my move,
Lies to admitted love, and self grow, not,
From thee muse, serving sets whate'er a still,
Speaking so shall say me to and so blot,
Self votary in sun's subscribes, on new quill,
Defaced if still from thy wards colour not,
Perfect show, thy shape toiled, me cold but me,
Doth rain body born, another's one plot,
Do to thence, my common fall in their i,
Calls will eisel make in the audit say,
This men's with these joy telling till away.

Haiku:
Must till deemed shook this,
So they ceremony have,
In thing may, under.

Limerick
Inheritors, so prime are and thy loss,
To i our gone sickly cross,
Seem cruel, to thou,
Almost in a brow,
Wherein mine, to ground, pay this cross.
