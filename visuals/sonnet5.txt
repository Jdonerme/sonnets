Sonnet:
Now i for me part, knows, forgot disgrace,
Doing tender in show, when thou then for,
Affections this, tincture made know'st chase,
Thine onset of owes thee, in then thou, nor,
Heart pleasing am him could for straight for each,
Are woe, 'thou be light, sings to all men's due,
When it seen sworn truth my thou, that are breach,
Robbery senses with and go, my view,
I justify be heart what my glass hath,
Not, as they yet with life mine rude going,
Such number love of thy right bristly bath,
I think in this, have acceptable for,
Change the lost: which do love composition,
Not altered that puts being mine merit.

Haiku:
Reasons nor of not,
Take form thy show, and love your,
Bewailed of the forced.

Limerick

My darling asked, as have heart, to,
Sweet but on golden lie since two,
Rich thy gust, and, smell,
No gave seen the bell,
That the story sweet, some wish hue.
