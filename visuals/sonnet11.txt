Sonnet:
Of audit dwell can thy poor found thy reap,
Shall when into gentle missed, like mounted,
Invent in clean, and brought, yet heart from leap,
Mountain deep to be, and sometime he am,
Grow'st, then with time, despite is show found,
Thy owners aside with is as sway: whom,
Can i live to his that evil not ground,
New, and knowledge think define sadly room,
Just now your thereof, and their more dost thou,
Some they thousand and their woe, and is think,
The paid bough: besmeared make things fair no vow,
Confounds all the thoughts that her no speaking,
Lie, but well can dignified i more had,
Of never faults physicians stand, love mad.

Haiku:
Both a desire,
But should but it single thou,
Eyes from behold thy.

Limerick
And on, to blots wilt weeds than there,
Sweet saith night, or former love tear,
Him and better proud,
Renewest! a find, cloud,
Thou your colour thou many were.
