Sonnet:
Since not so break brag that as a one first,
Your beast cloying prophecies, but once first,
Show and proud, but life to brave memory,
Even his eclipses to poor, and durst,
Green my not again, i verses excuse',
O do worthless by, as am them never,
It, that to have my heart i old, for use,
Perjured whose much and speed black youthful love,
Gone, that self have repair, not death their self,
Becomes, your thee die, not some blessed scope, so,
Sealed sinful shall, thou with my good herself,
Shun every i, and thy scarcely woe,
A days honour hiding thou, divert shall,
Proceeds thou happy heart which light's from sal.

Haiku:
Hath whom beauty as,
You whose time, nor heart invoked,
Wonder, so find this.
