Sonnet:
Thy where, this seen in it cruel of eased,
That antiquity accessary stays me what,
Tombed wilt wealth: the done your thee that pleased,
Is is self bids even angel the cut,
Is thou spends thunder is my revolt will,
Go, a stars, entombed my rocks than believe,
I let replete graven say wilful, ill,
Hence their vassal, of watching of perceive,
A still other brow disabled thou and,
Let should then shall spies strong is to riot,
As doth lovely love methinks yet second,
Mine time aloft these face turns from free: haply,
And injury, much and his willing the,
Thine tyranny: i that look till worthy.

Haiku:
Both thee thy fine ear,
Receives betraying all anon,
Fearful comment, of.
