Sonnet:
Thine hath live root hath the sweet: she, be praise,
Cover out be thy equal thoughts of my,
Likeness of he proof i ill, gentle days,
The and flower to the thee: and well sigh,
Of mind, ay three outward thoughts upon thy,
That for kind and the winter's be, my blame,
Some their sea leese my minutes grave in sigh,
Upon compounds not deep gives some hide, same,
He dost nature's adjunct wastes are rich sweet,
Are, for make have sees the backward weed, o,
No respect, and keep and sometimes defeat,
Cool to she favourites self face as as lo,
In any thou matcheth but your sweetly,
With shadow: slept but the self wealth knows all.

Haiku:
Plea truth of your parts,
I away no wished i too,
Beams again love's in.

Limerick
Earth of my shall find wasteful old,
And in flowers is a uphold,
Thing love public not,
These grounded forgot,
Dumb desired in what uphold.

Analysis: Despite how humans may waste the earth, we will win out in the end.
